          1. Background and Research Problems
     </h1>
     <label>
          It has been so many news reports of earthquake all over the world. There are lots of rumors which bring us doomsday arguments.
     </label>
     <label>
          · At this moment, where in the world are earthquakes taking place?
     </label>
     <label>
          · In China, which parts of region are more likely to earthquake?
     </label>
     <label>
          · What is trend of frequency of earthquake all around the world like?
     </label>

     <h1>
          2. Results
     </h1>
     <p>
          We can draw a lot of information from the visualization tool. The circle indicates that the earthquake occurred, and the location of the origin indicates where the earthquake occurred. In addition, the Numbers in the circle represent the number of earthquakes in the area, and the larger the number, the darker the color.
     </p>
     <p>
          Firstly, China's earthquakes were mainly concentrated in the western provinces of sichuan, yunnan, Tibet, qinghai, gansu, xinjiang and Taiwan in the east, where plate activity is frequent. So people living in these areas need to pay more attention to earthquake knowledge and escape skills. People in other provinces need not worry too much about earthquakes, nor should they. In addition, China's surrounding Nepal, myanmar, the Philippines, Japan and other countries, is often visited by earthquakes.
     </p>
     <p>
          Indonesia and Japan have the most earthquakes in the world. Indonesia, in particular, has had 15,661 earthquakes of magnitude 4.5 or more since 2000, or an average of 2.2 a day. In addition, there are the Philippines in Asia, Papua New Guinea, tonga, vanuatu, New Zealand, Solomon islands in Oceania, Chile in South America, and Alaska in North America.
     </p>

     <h1>
          3. Discussion
     </h1>
     <p>
          We can get the results from the visualization clearly and vividly. I mapped the occurrence of an earthquake to a visual mark represented as a dot. And data attributes such as frequency will be mapped to the color of dot with a exact number. 
     <p>
          Utilizing a map to show the information highly related to geography is a intuitive and efficient way. Interactive information query method is more conducive to the interest and simplicity of information query.
     </p>
     </p>
     As for the weakness of this approach, it is clearly lacking in aggregate statistics. It is difficult to summarize a certain statistical index in different dimensions. For example, I want to clearly compare the top 10 countries with the most earthquakes in the last decade, or I want to calculate the change in earthquake frequency around the world.
     <p>
     </p>

     <h1>
          4. Conclusion
     </h1>
     <p>
          I will provide more information in the interactive buttons of each country. If such as pie chart, line chart and other chart information, to broaden the visual information dimension. For example, I could use a line chart to track the earthquake frequency trends in each country and a pie chart to record the earthquake types in that region.
     </p>
     <p>
          In addition, more meaningful issues can be studied and related to media news development to discuss the relationship between human and natural disasters. For example, are there really more earthquakes?     </p>

          5. Literature
     </h1>
     <p>
          In the article (http://bl.ocks.org/vswetha01/609ee20dfabe079f40e675e300dbaf58), the authors collected seismic data from the U.S. geological survey. This chart shows the earthquakes that have occurred in the world over the past 15 years. The magnitude is above 6.0. The death toll from Nepal's earthquake, which killed more than 5,000 people, is still rising, but it still falls short of the hundreds of thousands killed by the deadliest earthquake in history. The columns in my database are time, latitude, longitude, depth, size, and location. The authors use the Python panda framework to transform the data, develop an exploratory plot, and group the data using the panda dataframe.    
      </p>
      <p>
          As for the article (https://anthonyskelton.com/2016/d3-js-earthquake-visualizations/), the authors used d3 to visualize the distribution of earthquakes. He had all of the quakes displaying, but he wanted some way to have the circles show up in the order that they happened. If there were twenty quakes but one an hour in an area, that would be very different all twenty in just one hour.

          He first set the radius of all of the quakes to zero and have them expand to the correct size over time. But the problem was he needed to find a way figure out how long to set between each quakes reveal. Each quake has the a time object in their properties. He started with a new date object that was 24 hours ago.

          It’s great that the quakes are happening at roughly the right time increments over the last 24 hours, but he also implemented a clock or something so people could see the pace of the quakes as they are happening.
